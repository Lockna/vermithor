# vermithor
Emulator with a convenient way to support new and multiple architectures written in C++

## About
The goal of this emulator project is to provide an easy way to define a whole platform via a config file.
The platform consists of a cpu architecture and multiple devices (framebuffer, RAM, GPU, ...).
Using an approach like this should enable one to create emulators for various platforms in one projects, given the architecture and devices needed are implemented.
